\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclision}
In this work the system of two superconducting wires connected with a tunnel junction is considered. The spectrum is obtained, the supercurrent and the ionization rate for $ g_R\gg \abs{g_L} $ is calculated. Despite the fact, that the ionization in this limit is factorized, it possesses it's own reach physics with four different regimes of ionization.

Authors hope, that the results of this work can be used for improving the techniques of detecting Majorana fermions in superconducting wires
